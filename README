PURPOSE

Provides a factory for creating Comparable implementations that
contain a tuple and compare the fields in that tuple against a tuple
that has a greater number of fields. The parital tuple has idenditical
types as the parallel fields in the full tuple. The comparison between
the parital tuple and the full tuple is type safe.

THANKS FOR THE TUPLES

The typles are supplied by the com.mallardsoft.tuple library written by
Michael L Perry.

This library is succinct and its design encouraged me to find a solution
to partial comparison that favored immutability.

MOTIVATION

This library was developed to create a type safe implementation of of
searches against indexes in an object database, where partial searches
are commonly desired. For example, if you index a person object by last
name then first name, you may then want to take advantage of the
ordering to use the compound index to search using only a last name. You
would simply ignore the first name when searching the index.

In Java 1.4 I'd simply used an array of Comparable instances to represent
tuples. Anticipating criticism over type safety in Java 1.5, I sought a
type safe solution. This has been an exercise in finding the limits of
Java's generics mechanism.
